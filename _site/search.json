Even when legal documents are available online, they are often written in complex terms that are hard to interpret.\nAs a data science student, I wanted to bridge this gap — using AI not to replace lawyers, but to assist users in understanding labor laws clearly and quickly."

    "text": "System Overview\nThe Law AI Helper consists of three main parts:\n\nDocument Retrieval (RAG) – The system reads and indexes labor law documents using vector embeddings.\nAPI Integration – The backend connects to an LLM API (like OpenAI or Gemini) for natural language responses.\nUser Query Interface – Users can ask legal questions in plain language, and the system retrieves relevant sections before generating a summarized, accurate response.\n\nFor example, if a user asks:\n\n“Can my employer fire me without notice?”\n\nThe system searches its indexed documents for related clauses about “termination” or “dismissal,” then summarizes the relevant labor law passages before answering."
