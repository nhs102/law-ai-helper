    "text": "Motivation\nMany people struggle to understand legal language or find the right information about their workplace rights. Even when legal documents are available online, they are often written in complex terms that are hard to interpret.\nAs a data science student, I wanted to bridge this gap — using AI not to replace lawyers, but to assist users in understanding labor laws clearly and quickly."

    "text": "System Overview\nThe Law AI Helper consists of three main parts:\n\nDocument Retrieval (RAG) – The system reads and indexes labor law documents using vector embeddings.\nAPI Integration – The backend connects to an LLM API (like OpenAI or Gemini) for natural language responses.\nUser Query Interface – Users can ask legal questions in plain language, and the system retrieves relevant sections before generating a summarized, accurate response.\n\nFor example, if a user asks:\n\n“Can my employer fire me without notice?”\n\nThe system searches its indexed documents for related clauses about “termination” or “dismissal,” then summarizes the relevant labor law passages before answering."
